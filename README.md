Hey! I wrote a game like planet vs zombies but more **crapy**

----------

## Note: ##
it was one of my first projects in c++ and i dont use make file at all !

and 

You should install SDL library first.

## How to use ? ##
in Main repository run this command :
```
g++ Main.cpp && a.out
```

For MacOsx you should run :
```
g++ Main.cpp rsdl.cpp -F/Library/Frameworks -framework SDL2 -framework SDL2_image -framework SDL2_ttf
```
